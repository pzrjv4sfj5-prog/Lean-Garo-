# Claude D Transformation Spec — Garo→English → English→Garo

Status: draft, first version. Written 2026-07-17 by Claude A after finding
concrete data loss in the first sample flip (page 89) and a schema
collision with `scripts/import-dictionary.js` (built independently by
Claude B the same day). Supersedes any informal understanding of what
"Claude D" does until revised.

## Why two stages, not one

The instinct is "Gemini → Claude D → repository" in one hop. That's
wrong for this repo specifically: `scripts/import-dictionary.js`
already exists, expects a flat `{english, garo, category?, pos?,
classifier?, notes?}` shape, and *rejects* any entry with an unknown
field as a validation error rather than dropping it silently. Claude
D's richer object (pos_groups, examples, ocr_confidence,
flagged_for_review, cross_references) would fail that importer
outright.

So: two stages, two artifacts, two different risk profiles.

```
Gemini canonical Garo→English JSON  (unchanged, already specified)
        ↓
STAGE 1 — Claude D: lossless flip
        ↓
docs/RAW_IMPORTS/<page>_en_garo_full.json   (rich, archival, permanent)
        ↓
STAGE 2 — mechanical reduction (script, not a new Claude instance)
        ↓
flat {english, garo, category?, pos?, classifier?, notes?} batch
        ↓
scripts/import-dictionary.js   (already exists, already validated)
        ↓
master_dictionary.json / docs/PENDING_DICTIONARY_IMPORT_CONFLICTS.md
```

Stage 1 output is never deleted, even after Stage 2 runs. It's the
only place `ocr_confidence`, `flagged_for_review`, and full
`pos_groups` survive — exactly the fields that caught the
`teacher`/`ti·char` compilation bug and the `A·breng` POS mismatch.
Losing them at the reduction step is fine, because reduction is
mechanical and re-runnable; losing them at the *flip* step is not,
because the flip is the only thing that ever sees the Gemini source.

## Stage 1 — Claude D lossless flip

### Field mapping (canonical Garo→English page object → flipped object)

| Source field (Gemini schema) | Target field | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `page`, `source_image`, `leading_continuation_text` | same, unchanged | copied verbatim, once per page, not per entry |
| `direction: "garo_to_english"` | `direction: "english_to_garo"` | the only field whose *value* changes |
| `entries[].headword_raw` | `entries[].garo_form_raw` | **renamed**, not repurposed — see naming rule below |
| `entries[].entry_type` | `entries[].entry_type` | copied verbatim; see entry_type rule below for affix handling |
| `entries[].raka_note` | `entries[].raka_note` | copied verbatim |
| `entries[].pos_groups[].pos` | `entries[].pos_groups[].pos` | copied verbatim, structure preserved (no flattening) |
| `entries[].pos_groups[].senses[]` | one flipped entry per sense string | see fan-out rule below |
| `entries[].examples[]` | `entries[].examples[]` | copied verbatim, unchanged direction (still `{garo, english}`, not reversed) |
| `entries[].cross_references` | `entries[].cross_references` | copied verbatim — **do not drop** (observed missing from schema entirely in the page-89 sample) |
| `entries[].notes` | `entries[].source_notes` | renamed for clarity that this is Gemini's note, not Claude D's |
| `entries[].ocr_confidence` | `entries[].ocr_confidence` | copied verbatim — **do not drop** (observed missing in the page-89 sample) |
| `entries[].flagged_for_review` | `entries[].flagged_for_review` | copied verbatim, unmodified. Claude D never clears or sets this — only Gemini (upstream) and Claude A (downstream review) may touch it |

### Naming rule

Never reuse a source field name for a value with a different meaning
across directions. The page-89 sample called the English gloss
`headword_raw`, which was `Skigipa`/`Cha·mata`/etc. (the Garo form) in
the source schema. Same key, opposite meaning, across two files that
sit next to each other in the same pipeline — a guaranteed future bug.
Rule: the Garo string is always `garo_form_raw` in every artifact this
pipeline produces, regardless of direction. The English string is
always `english_gloss_raw`.

### Fan-out rule (one Garo→English entry → many English→Garo rows)

A single canonical entry usually has multiple senses (e.g. `Chalak,
adj.: Clever; cunning; shrewd; tactful; ...`). Each sense becomes its
own flipped row, all pointing at the same Garo form:

```json
{"garo_form_raw": "Chalak", "english_gloss_raw": "Clever", "pos": "adj.", "parent_headword": "Chalak", ...}
{"garo_form_raw": "Chalak", "english_gloss_raw": "cunning", "pos": "adj.", "parent_headword": "Chalak", ...}
```

`parent_headword` is new (not in the page-89 sample) — see the
affix-example rule immediately below for why it's required, not
optional.

### entry_type rule (this must be written down, not improvised)

Canonical `entry_type` is `"lexical"` or `"affix"` — a closed
two-value enum, per the Gemini extraction spec. Claude D must not
invent a third value. The page-89 sample introduced
`"entry_type": "example"` for affix worked-examples on the fly; that
stops now. Affix worked-examples become flipped rows with:

- `entry_type: "affix_example"` (a real, spec'd third value, not an
  ad hoc one) — OR simply nested under the parent affix entry as an
  `examples` array (preferred; matches how the source already nests
  them). **Use nesting, not flat sibling rows with a prose backlink.**

Concretely: an affix entry flips to *one* row per affix (not one row
per example), carrying its full `examples[]` array as a proper nested
field:

```json
{
  "garo_form_raw": "-grogro",
  "entry_type": "affix",
  "english_gloss_raw": "A suffix denoting the early hours of day appended to pring",
  "pos": null,
  "examples": [
    {"garo": "pringgrogro", "english": "early hours of the morning"}
  ],
  "flagged_for_review": true
}
```

This eliminates the `"source_notes": "Example illustrating affix
-grogro"` pattern entirely — that was a foreign key encoded as a
sentence, unqueryable and one rewording away from silently breaking.

### Verification requirement

Stage 1 output must pass `scripts/verify-claude-d-flip.js` (below)
before it's considered committed. Not a suggestion — a gate. The
script does not evaluate translation quality or linguistic content; it
only asserts nothing was dropped, renamed silently, or invented outside
the enum. Claude A does linguistic review separately, after this gate
passes.

## Stage 2 — mechanical reduction to the flat importer shape

Purely mechanical, script-driven (no LLM call needed at all for this
stage — it's a field-selection problem, not a judgment problem):

| Stage 1 field | Flat importer field | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `english_gloss_raw` | `english` | copied |
| `garo_form_raw` | `garo` | copied |
| `pos` (per pos_group) | `pos` | copied if present, else omitted |
| — | `category` | not derivable from source; omitted (importer treats as optional) |
| — | `classifier` | not derivable from source; omitted |
| `source_notes` | `notes` | copied if present, else omitted |

Entries with `entry_type: "affix"` are **excluded** from Stage 2
entirely — `master_dictionary.json` / `import-dictionary.js` model
single-word lexical entries only; affixes belong in
`MORPHOLOGY_SPECIFICATION.md`'s domain, not the flat dictionary. Same
for any entry with `flagged_for_review: true` — those route to human/
Claude A review first, never straight into the importer's clean-batch
path, regardless of what the importer's own conflict detection would
have caught anyway. This is a stricter gate than the importer applies
by default, intentionally: Stage 2 should never hand the importer
something Gemini itself already flagged as uncertain.

## What Claude D must never do (unchanged from original framing, now itemized against real risks observed)

- Never invent enum values not in this spec (observed: `entry_type: "example"`)
- Never drop a field present in the source (observed: `ocr_confidence`, `cross_references`)
- Never reuse a field name for a different meaning across directions (observed: `headword_raw`)
- Never encode a structural relationship as a prose sentence (observed: affix↔example backlink via `source_notes`)
- Never merge, split, deduplicate, or reorder senses beyond the fan-out rule above
- Never touch `flagged_for_review` — read-only for Claude D
- Never alter Unicode, raka marks (·), hyphens, or spacing in any Garo or English string
