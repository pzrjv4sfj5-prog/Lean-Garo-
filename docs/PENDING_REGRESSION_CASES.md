# Pending Regression Cases
_Started: 2026-07-08 by Claude B. Restructured 2026-07-11 into
Implemented/Pending sections (was growing into an append-only historical
log — reorganized to stay usable as an operational backlog per explicit
instruction)._

## Purpose
Every weakness the Native Sentence Validation Audit (or later evidence)
exposes gets logged here with the exact input/output pair, so fixes can
be reviewed and implemented without re-deriving the evidence.

## Format
- **Implemented**: closed. Cites the commit that fixed it. Full forensic
  detail (why the bug existed, root cause analysis) lives in that
  commit's message, not duplicated here — this doc keeps only what's
  needed to know it's done and where to look if you need more.
- **Pending**: still open. Input, current output, expected output (if
  known), suspected cause, severity, and what's blocking it (Claude A
  review vs. Thangseng validation).

## Implemented

### RC-CANDIDATE-002 — Locative "in bed" got object marker instead of locative
**Fixed:** `d0e6c06` (2026-07-10). `translationEngine.js`'s SOV
grammar-assembly now marks a stative-locative adjunct (`in`/`on`/`at` +
noun) with `·o` instead of the default `·ko`. `"I am lying in bed"` →
`Anga palang·o` (matches native-confirmed `palango`). New regression
case added same commit.

### RC-CANDIDATE-003 — Posture verb "lying" produced malformed/invalid Garo
**Partially fixed:** `d0e6c06` (2026-07-10). Both confirmed-invalid
outputs (`"down"` wrongly picked as verb via the unrelated
`corrections.json` `down`=`Ka·ma` entry; `"bed"` wrongly picked as verb
then given a past-tense suffix → invalid `Palangha`) now produce
grammatically valid, if semantically incomplete, output instead of
invalid Garo. **Still open:** the full `tue`/posture-verb paradigm needs
native validation (tracked as NV-007 in
`docs/THANGSENG_NATIVE_VALIDATION.md`) before "lying (in bed)" can be
translated correctly, not just gracefully.

### RC-CANDIDATE-006 — Purpose-clause "search" used pre-Rule-32 stale value
**Fixed:** `d0e6c06` (2026-07-10). `src/data/purpose_map.json`'s
`search` corrected from the retired `am·e·nik·na` to `Sandi·na`.

### RC-CANDIDATE-008 (partial) — irregular-verb table conflicts
**Fixed 5 of 9:** `d0e6c06` (2026-07-10) — `coming`, `slept`, `sleeping`,
`laughing` (truncation typos / missing raka marks, confirmed against
`THANGSENG_RULES_LOOKUP.md`'s raka table and internal corpus
consistency). **Not a bug:** `eaten` — `cha·jok` (perfect) and
`cha·manaha` (completive) are both independently confirmed distinct
aspectual forms (RULE-026); no fix needed, permanently allowlisted in
`repository-intelligence.js`. **Reverted:** `bought` was fixed then
retracted (`df71a83`) — see Pending below, genuinely unresolved.
**Still open:** `heard`, `standing`, `sitting` — see Pending below.

### VerbsGrammar.jsx (5 errors) + dead phrase_maps.js hortatives
**Fixed:** `48aee52` (2026-07-11). Not originally RC-numbered (found via
direct Claude A review of the user-facing grammar page, not the Native
Sentence Validation Audit), but same disposition — flagged with zero
ambiguity, checkable against existing confirmed data, implemented
directly. See commit message for the 5 specific corrections (raka on
`agan`/`nika`, hyphen-as-raka typos, a truncation typo, reversed
classifier-number order, a copy-pasted imperative example) and the 5
dead `phrase_maps.js` entries removed (shadowed by `corrections.json`,
verified unreachable before removal).

## Pending

### RC-CANDIDATE-001 — Necessity-modal negation (`nangja`) collapses into desire-negation
- **Input:** `"I don't need to watch TV"` → `Anga sikengja` (collapses
  into the `sikenga`/"want" + negation path)
- **Cause:** Grammar — no distinct necessity-modal negation path exists
- **Status:** Needs Claude A Review, then Thangseng Validation of the
  correct isolated-clause form

### RC-CANDIDATE-004 — Ability modal ("can") dropped entirely
- **Input:** `"I can watch"` / `"I can eat"` → identical to the
  non-modal form, no `man·a`/`man·ienga` marking at all
- **Cause:** Selection Logic — `master_dictionary.json` has `"can":
  "man·a"` but nothing wires it into modal-verb constructions
- **Status:** **Blocked — do not implement.** Claude A: the `man·a`
  source entry itself is unverified (NV-008). Wiring an unverified form
  into the engine would be worse than the current gap.

### RC-CANDIDATE-005 — English loanwords (`TV`, `status`) silently dropped
- **Input:** `"I watch TV"` → `Anga ni·rik·a` (TV vanishes, no error
  marker — silent data loss, worse than a visible `[UNKNOWN]`)
- **Cause:** Dictionary + Rendering — no pass-through mechanism for
  unrecognized capitalized tokens
- **Status:** Needs Claude A Review — Claude A has recommended a
  systematic loanword passthrough mechanism over per-word entries (in
  principle); not yet designed or implemented

### RC-CANDIDATE-007 — `sing`/`dance` purpose-clause forms use unrelated roots
- **Input:** `"i want to sing"` → `purpose_map.json`'s `bit·na`, vs.
  `corrections.json`'s `ring·a` (now confirmed correct — see NV-010,
  `ring·a`="sing" and `ringa`="drink" are genuinely different roots).
  `"i want to dance"` → `ruru·na` vs. `Chroka`, fully open.
- **Status:** Needs Thangseng Validation. The `sing` candidate fix
  (`bit·na`→`ring·na`) is medium-confidence only per Claude A — not
  swapped silently. `dance` has no evidence either way yet.

### RC-CANDIDATE-008 (remainder) — 4 unresolved irregular-verb/corrections conflicts
| Key | `corrections.json` | `irregular_verbs.json` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bought` | `breaha` | `brea·aha` | Escalated — `VALIDATION_CORPUS.md` already has `"have you bought"`→`Bre·ajok` (raka, Verified/High from a prior audit pass), directly conflicting with the primary-source no-raka claim. Two credible sources disagree — needs Thangseng, not a repo-evidence call. |
| `heard` | `rangsan chanchiaha` | `knachik·aha` | Escalated — different words entirely, no repo evidence favors either |
| `standing` | `chadatenga` | `chadenga` | Escalated — no primary-source confirmation of either root's raka status; a third form (`Chakata`) also exists elsewhere, may be a 3-way vocabulary question |
| `sitting` | `asongenga` | `asong·enga` | Escalated — same as `standing`, no confirmation found |

All 4 permanently allowlisted in `repository-intelligence.js` pending
Thangseng.

### RC-CANDIDATE-009 — 18 raka-adjacency candidates (report-only)
Surfaced by `repository-intelligence.js` Check A (deliberately
report-only — see `docs/REPOSITORY_INTELLIGENCE.md`). **Partially
resolved:** the `ring·`-related hits (8 of 18) are confirmed **not
bugs** — `ring·a`="sing" is a genuinely different root from the
no-raka verb `ringa`="drink" (NV-010, narrowed 2026-07-10). **Still
open:** `agan·` (3 hits, "did/have/are you speak(ing)") and `tusi·` (1
hit, "I will sleep") look like plausible genuine RULE-001 candidates —
no alternate-word explanation found. `nam·` (2 hits, "loved the
picture") may be an idiom, unconfirmed. `wa·` (4 hits, bamboo) is
likely an unrelated word (bamboo ≠ rain), probably not a violation at
all.
- **Status:** Needs Claude A Review for the remaining `agan·`/`tusi·`/
  `nam·`/`wa·` clusters (10 of the original 18 hits).

## Explicitly out of scope
- Nothing in the Pending section above has been fixed — only logged.
- Severity/priority labels are Claude B's engineering assessment only —
  not a substitute for Claude A's linguistic triage or Thangseng's
  validation of expected outputs.
